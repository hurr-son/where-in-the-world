# where-in-the-world

Overview:

I want to create a geoguessr type game but strictly with satellite imagery. 
There is already a mod of geoguessr that does this, but I thought it would be fun challenge to create this. 

Features:

Generate random location on a basemap for user
User selects spot on an interactive map popup
Calculate score based on how close the user was to the area
Allow for user leaderboards
